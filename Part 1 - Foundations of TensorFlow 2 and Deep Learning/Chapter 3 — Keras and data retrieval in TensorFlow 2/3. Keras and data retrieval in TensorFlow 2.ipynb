# Chapter 3 — Keras and Data Retrieval in TensorFlow 2

This chapter explains how to build neural network models using the three Keras
APIs and how to retrieve datasets efficiently in TensorFlow. All figures appear
in the same order as in the original textbook.

## 3.1 Keras model-building APIs 

Keras offers three methods for building models depending on architecture
complexity: the Sequential API, the Functional API, and the Sub-classing API.
Each approach provides different flexibility, making Keras suitable for both
beginners and advanced developers.

Before creating a model, it is important to explore the dataset used for
training. This includes understanding feature distributions, class balance, and
necessary preprocessing steps.

Datasets typically undergo preprocessing such as decoding, resizing,
normalization, batching, shuffling, and prefetching.

### Sequential API

The Sequential API is the simplest way to build models in Keras. Layers are
stacked in a linear fashion—one input, one output—making it ideal for simple
architectures.

### Functional API

The Functional API allows the construction of more flexible and complex
networks. It supports multi-input and multi-output models, branching layers,
and shared layer components.

### Sub-classing API

The Sub-classing API gives full control over model behavior by allowing the
developer to define custom Python classes. This is useful for highly customized
architectures or research-oriented models.

## 3.2 Retrieving data for TensorFlow/Keras models

TensorFlow supports several methods for loading datasets:  
the `tf.data` API, Keras DataGenerators, and the TensorFlow-Datasets (TFDS)
package. The right choice depends on dataset size and required preprocessing.

---

### 3.2.1 tf.data API

The `tf.data` API provides a highly scalable and efficient input pipeline. It
supports parallel reading, caching, shuffling, mapping transformations,
batching, and prefetching—making it ideal for large datasets.

### 3.2.2 Keras DataGenerators

Keras DataGenerators are useful for loading images directly from directories.
They support on-the-fly data augmentation and allow streaming of data that
does not fit entirely into memory.

---

### 3.2.3 tensorflow-datasets (TFDS)

TFDS provides standardized, ready-to-use datasets with automatic downloading,
validation, and built-in train/test splits. It is the fastest way to load common
benchmark datasets.

## Summary

Chapter 3 introduces the three Keras model-building APIs—Sequential,
Functional, and Sub-classing—and the three main TensorFlow data-loading
methods: `tf.data`, DataGenerators, and TFDS. Together, these tools form a
flexible, scalable pipeline for deep learning workflows in TensorFlow 2.
