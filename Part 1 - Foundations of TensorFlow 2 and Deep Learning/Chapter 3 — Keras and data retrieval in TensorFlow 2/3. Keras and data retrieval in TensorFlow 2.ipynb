This chapter introduces how to build neural network models using Keras APIs
and how to retrieve datasets efficiently using TensorFlow’s data pipeline tools.

## 3.1 Keras model-building APIs

Keras provides three main approaches to build neural networks depending on the
complexity of the architecture: the Sequential API, the Functional API, and the
Sub-classing API. Each API offers a different balance between simplicity and
flexibility.

Before building the model, it is important to understand the dataset used for
training. This includes exploring feature distributions, class balance, and any
required preprocessing.

The dataset typically goes through a series of preprocessing steps such as
decoding, resizing, normalization, batching, and shuffling.

### Sequential API

The Sequential API is the simplest and most intuitive way to build neural
networks — layers are stacked one after another with a single input and a
single output flow.

### Functional API

The Functional API supports more complex models such as multi-input networks,
multi-output networks, shared layers, and branching paths. Most modern deep
learning architectures (ResNet, Inception, etc.) use this API.

### Sub-classing API

Subclassing offers maximum flexibility by allowing developers to define entire
models as custom Python classes with a custom `call()` method. This is useful
for research and highly customized architectures.

## 3.2 Retrieving data for TensorFlow/Keras models

TensorFlow provides three major mechanisms for loading data:  
the `tf.data` API, Keras DataGenerators, and the TensorFlow-Datasets (TFDS)
package. The right method depends on dataset size and pipeline complexity.

---

### 3.2.1 tf.data API

The `tf.data` API is the most scalable and configurable input pipeline solution.
It supports parallel I/O, caching, shuffling, batching, mapping transformations,
and prefetching — essential for large datasets and high-performance training.

### 3.2.2 Keras DataGenerators

Keras DataGenerators are simple tools for loading images from directories.
They support real-time augmentation and can stream data even when it doesn't
fit in memory.

---

### 3.2.3 tensorflow-datasets (TFDS)

TFDS provides ready-to-use datasets with automatic downloading, extraction,
validation and standardized splits, making it the fastest option for loading
benchmark datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and IMDB.

## Summary

Chapter 3 presents the three Keras APIs for building neural networks
(Sequential, Functional, and Sub-classing) and introduces the three main ways
to retrieve data in TensorFlow (tf.data, DataGenerators, TFDS).  
Together, these tools provide a flexible and scalable workflow for building
deep learning models in TensorFlow 2.
