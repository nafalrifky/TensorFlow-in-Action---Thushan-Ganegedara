# Chapter 3 — Keras and Data Retrieval in TensorFlow 2

This chapter explains how to build neural network models using the three Keras
APIs and how to retrieve datasets efficiently in TensorFlow. All figures are
included in the same order as in the original textbook.

## 3.1 Keras model-building APIs

Keras offers three ways to build neural networks depending on architectural
complexity: the Sequential API, the Functional API, and the Sub-classing API.
Each method provides different flexibility and ease of use.

Before building a model, it is important to gain an understanding of the
dataset: its features, distribution, and any preprocessing requirements.

Real datasets usually require a preprocessing chain, including decoding,
resizing, normalization, batching, shuffling, and prefetching.

### Sequential API

The Sequential API is the simplest way to build neural networks. Layers are
stacked in a fixed, linear sequence, making it ideal for straightforward models.

### Functional API

The Functional API enables the creation of more flexible architectures with
branching, merging, shared layers, and multi-input or multi-output flows. This
API is used in most real-world deep learning models.

### Sub-classing API

The Sub-classing API provides maximum control by letting developers define
models using standard Python classes. This is especially useful for research or
custom architectures.

## 3.2 Retrieving data for TensorFlow/Keras models

TensorFlow provides multiple mechanisms to load data efficiently based on
dataset size, model requirements, and performance needs.

---

### 3.2.1 tf.data API

The `tf.data` API offers a scalable and highly configurable pipeline system. It
supports parallel input reading, caching, shuffling, mapping, batching, and
prefetching.

### 3.2.2 Keras DataGenerators

DataGenerators load images directly from folders and support real-time data
augmentation. They are suitable for medium-sized datasets that do not fit fully
into memory.

---

### 3.2.3 tensorflow-datasets (TFDS)

TFDS offers standardized datasets with automated downloading, extraction,
validation, and built-in train/test splits. It is the quickest way to load
common benchmark datasets.

## Summary

Chapter 3 introduced the three Keras APIs (Sequential, Functional, and
Sub-classing) and the three main data-loading mechanisms in TensorFlow
(tf.data, DataGenerators, and TFDS). These tools enable scalable and flexible
deep-learning workflows using TensorFlow 2.
