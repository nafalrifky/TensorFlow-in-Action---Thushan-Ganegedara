# Chapter 3 — Keras and Data Retrieval in TensorFlow 2

This chapter introduces the three Keras model–building APIs and explains how
TensorFlow retrieves, processes, and prepares datasets for machine learning
pipelines. The concepts are presented in the same structure and order as the
original book.

## 3.1 Keras model-building APIs

Keras offers three methods to construct neural network models depending on the
required flexibility and architecture complexity.

Before creating the model, it is essential to understand the dataset used for
training: feature shapes, label distributions, and the preprocessing required
to prepare the data.

Most datasets require preprocessing stages, including decoding, resizing,
normalizing, batching, and shuffling.

### Sequential API

The Sequential API is the simplest way to build models, using a single
straightforward stack of layers.

### Functional API

The Functional API extends flexibility by allowing multi–input, multi–output,
branched, and shared–layer networks—used widely in modern architectures such
as ResNet and Inception.

### Sub-classing API

The Sub-classing API provides full control by defining models as custom Python
classes with a custom forward pass, ideal for research or specialized network
designs.

## 3.2 Retrieving data for TensorFlow/Keras models

TensorFlow provides several mechanisms to load datasets efficiently, depending
on dataset size and complexity.

---

### 3.2.1 tf.data API

The `tf.data` API is the most scalable option for building complex, high–
performance input pipelines. It supports parallel reading, caching, mapping,
batching, and prefetching.

---

### 3.2.2 Keras DataGenerators

DataGenerators read images from directories and apply real–time augmentation.
They are suitable when the full dataset does not fit into memory.

---

### 3.2.3 tensorflow-datasets (TFDS)

TFDS automatically downloads, prepares, validates, and splits common datasets.
It is the fastest way to load standardized benchmark datasets.

## Summary

Chapter 3 introduced the three Keras model–building APIs:
Sequential, Functional, and Sub-classing. It also presented three methods of
retrieving data in TensorFlow: the tf.data API, DataGenerators, and TFDS.
Together, these tools form a flexible and scalable ML development workflow.
